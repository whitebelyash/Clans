# Clans
WIP Clans plugin for Spigot/etc...  
Also an attempt to copy VanillaCraft (an old russian server which is closed for now) clans.
VCClans was itself inspired by another plugin (i guess), which is feature-bloated IMHO

## why

coz i didn't find anything similar to VanillaCraft clans plugin.

## why not clansystem

coz the cs codebase is too complicated for me. Yup, shitty code at its best.  
(ClanSystem was my old attempt to recreate VCClans)
